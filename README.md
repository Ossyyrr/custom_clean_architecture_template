# Flutter Custom Template Project

This is a custom Flutter project template that I have created for sharing purposes. The template is designed with the following technologies:

- **Go Router:** Used for navigation within the application.
- **Freezed:** Employed for efficient and immutable data models.
- **Dio + Retrofit:** Utilized for connection services and API calls.
- **Flutter Bloc:** Integrated for effective state management.

## Features Implemented

### Authentication Controller
The project includes an authentication controller that manages user authentication, ensuring a secure and seamless experience.

### Splash Logic
A splash screen with custom logic is implemented to enhance the user experience during the app's launch.

### Home Screen
The home screen provides the following functionalities:

- **Logout:** Allows users to securely log out of their accounts.
- **Language Change:** Users can change the language of the application.
